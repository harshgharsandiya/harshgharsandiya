<p><em>Security Enthusist <br><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"><br><br>
 I am a Computer Engineer who is currently studying from Sarvajanik College Of Engineering And Technology, who has a keen interest in Penetration Testing, Web Application Security and who enjoy doing CTFs.

Coming to the practical implementation, I love making scripts in Bash and tools in python and golang to automate processes that take lots of time while pentesting web applications. On the way of doing that made me think to write blogs on the hunting Bugs so that I can share my experience with other enthusiasts.
